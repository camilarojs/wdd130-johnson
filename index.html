      <h2>Founding and Early Years (1988)</h2>
      <p>
        The Charlotte Hornets were established as an NBA expansion team and played their inaugural season in 1988.
        The franchise brought professional basketball to Charlotte, North Carolina—a city with a rich basketball culture.
        The team launched with a distinct identity featuring a teal and purple color scheme, a bold cartoon-style hornet logo,
        and pinstriped uniforms that became a visual hallmark of the era. Home games were played at the Charlotte Coliseum,
        affectionately known as “The Hive,” which quickly became one of the loudest venues in the league.

      <h2>1990s Growth and Popularity</h2>
      <p>
        During the 1990s, the Hornets grew in popularity, both locally and nationally. With a loyal fan base and a strong
        home-court atmosphere, the team became one of the most recognizable franchises in the NBA. They regularly ranked
        near the top in attendance and were known for their high-energy presentation and colorful branding.

      <h2>Relocation to New Orleans (2002)</h2>
      <p>
        After over a decade in Charlotte, the original Hornets franchise relocated to New Orleans in 2002.
        The move left Charlotte without an NBA team, marking the end of an era. The original Hornets history, colors,
        and branding traveled with the team to New Orleans at the time.

      <h2>Creation of the Charlotte Bobcats (2004)</h2>
      <p>
        In 2004, Charlotte was awarded a new NBA expansion team, which was named the Charlotte Bobcats.
        This marked the return of the NBA to the city, but with a completely new brand identity.
        The Bobcats played in a new downtown arena, which is now known as the Spectrum Center.
        Despite the new beginning, the Bobcats struggled to build the same cultural and emotional connection
        the Hornets once had.

      <h2>Return of the Hornets Identity (2014)</h2>
      <p>
        In a major rebranding move, the team officially changed its name from the Bobcats back to the Charlotte Hornets
        for the 2014–15 NBA season. This change was met with excitement from fans who had long called for the return of the
        original name and aesthetic. Along with the name change came the restoration of the iconic teal and purple colors,
        the “Hugo the Hornet” mascot, and a modernized version of the classic logo.

      <h2>Restoration of Franchise History</h2>
      <p>
        Alongside the rebrand, the NBA approved the transfer of the original Hornets’ historical records (from 1988 to 2002)
        back to Charlotte. This meant that all the team’s early accomplishments, statistics, and legacy once again belonged
        to the Charlotte Hornets, effectively uniting the franchise's past and present under a single banner.
